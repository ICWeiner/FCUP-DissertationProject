5/11
wireshark caps to understand why commands sometimes dont work 
Research about proxmox firewall, snapshots and containers vs VMs

12/11
changes in proxmox scripts related to VM operations
studied workings of proxmox firewall - https://ciaduck.blogspot.com/2020/04/proxmox-firewall-and-isolating-vms.html?m=1
wrote proxmox script to create firewall rules to isolate VMs
made some tests on snapshot speeds with and without ram

19/11
started work on flask
fixed some errors in firewall api script
restructed project folders
implemented some basic endpoints to interact with proxmox via the flask application
WSGI Research - https://www.fullstackpython.com/wsgi-servers.html
Gunicorn experiments on 'teacher' vm
Study of flask basics - https://hackersandslackers.com/series/build-flask-apps/


26/11
More work on flask (more restructuring, blueprints, etc.)
Integrated proxmox api calls with flask application
Working on implementing nornir tasks with flask application

03/12
GNS3 Web - explore (still in beta phase, altough from experimenting it seems feature complete)
Clone before evaluation - explore (cloning active VM is possible, but not with RAM which is what we want, not possible on containers with RAM, not with backups neither snapshots )
Explore use of containers in conjunction with GNS3 Web (possible, just install gns3-server on container)
Make more than 1 user use a single gns3 server (possible, but no user isolation, everything is shared, not desirable in exam setting)
Worked on site front end (just basic html and redirecting to gns3 web directly from site) 
Containers - cant seem to use ubuntu 24.04/10 (needs to update proxmox packages but always gives error) ((FIXED, had to change proxmox repository settings to update packages))

10/12
Write some documentation about flask app, proxmox api calls and nornir usage.

Containers - Setting up a template GNS3 Container (QEMU guest agent cant be run on containers, priviledged or not. is this a problem?
it actually can, by passing the host's /dev/kvm/ to the containers but doing so leaves open a big attack vector...
https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/kvm-inside-lxc-container.54168/
Switching from QEMU to docker within GNS3 seems doable, abandoning linux support in GNS3 doesn't...)

NETMIKO send_command might be the cause for tests sometimes not working "randomly" (fast_cli set to false, after some testing, problem seems taken care of... )

Containers - Contrary to VMs, IP seems to change frequently, solve this or workaround it? (non-issue)


17/12

GNS3 - multiple gns3 web server instances running on a single VM?(no, all instances can still access each other's files)

Docker in GNS3(still limited, alternative would be running any QEMU VM directly on proxmoxVE, good suggestion for future work)

Created a template GNS3-Server, provisioned with a working templates for a cisco router, switch, linux machine and VPCS, base on ubuntu 24.10
Did not use GNS3-VM due to it not being any easier to setup than our GNS3-Server.

Create a exercise ( problem definition (html markdown), tests to run (allow multiple (allow granular grading over a sets of steps)) ,with ability to import from file(csv for example), include gns3 topology with ability to insert pre configurations to be made after import)


2/01
(ongoing) create a exercise ( problem definition (html markdown), tests to run (allow multiple (allow granular grading over a sets of steps)) ,with ability to import from file(csv for example), include gns3 topology with ability to insert pre configurations to be made after import)
- added a database to the flask application
- worked on creating a vm for a student when required(not finished)
- refined database uml definition
- added login and signup capabilites(currently disabled for ease of development)

8/01:

VM creation
- fixed a few errors in database implementation
- wrote code to clone template vm into work vm using event listeners (after_insert)
- rewrote code to not use event listeners, now fires manually, as event listeners were causing some sequences, and were perhaps overkill

implemented proxmox authentication token storage, reducing # of calls to API

small documentation work

14/01:
(ongoing) create a exercise ( problem definition (html markdown), tests to run (allow multiple (allow granular grading over a sets of steps)) ,with ability to import from file(csv for example), include gns3 topology with ability to insert pre configurations to be made after import)
- Focus on exercise definition form
- Client side form (separation of concerns)
