This chapters main focus is to provide the reader with the necessary background information to understand the context of
this project. The main goal of this project is to provide a system capable of automatically evaluating network topologies 
by validating configurations and running tests on different devices in the network. Analogue systems exist in the market,
primarily focused in programming. These systems receive code from students and subsequently run tests on it against 
multiples test cases. These systems are already widely deployed in universities and other educational institutions. 
Shifting from programming to network topologies appears simple but comes with a particular 
set of challenges not present in programming evaluations. Each student will require an individual network topology to work 
on, which can be addressed by using virtualization platforms. There is also the matter of communicating with the devices 
in the network, which can be addressed by using network automation tools. Finally there is the matter of combining these 
technologies to create a system capable of automatically evaluating network topologies.

\section{Programming Evaluation Systems}
While not directly related, they are the main inspiration for this project. Programming evaluation systems are widely
deployed in universities and other educational institutions. These systems receive code from students and subsequently run
tests on it against multiples test cases, outputting a score and even being configurable to provide students the first test
case that they failed in, guiding students to the solution without handing it out. In the context of the\ac{dcc}, Mooshak and Codex are commonly deployed to be used in the context of classes and even 
exams and programming contests.l
