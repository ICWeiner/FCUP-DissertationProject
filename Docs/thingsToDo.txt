additional modules

send "ctrl + c" before sending commands and general sanitization of inputs in VMs

switch to netmiko's "send_command_timing" if bug rearises

Regular Expression traceroute

Insert authentication(jwt) in endpoints that should be protected, such as creation and starting, stoping of VMs

reenable login capabilites

make vm creation logic more scalable (celery seems like a good option)

figure out configuration of template VM (base gns3-vm -> provision with gns3-topology -> run provided commands -> convert into template -> clone for use)

mark exercises as active/inactive?

make the "connect to work environment", "start" and "stop" buttons interact with the correct vm, given a user and exercise
